# The plan is to build a suite of scripts/tools that I commonly use in my
# game dev processes that maybe other people can use as well. Mostly will
# be relevant to Unity but might also mix in some Godot and Unreal stuff.

# Not sure if this will stay one project with lots of scripts or eventually
# break out into multiple projects with a main driver project.
