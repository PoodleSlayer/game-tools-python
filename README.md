# Game Dev Tools

This project serves as a collection of helpful scripts and tools that I make while working on my various game projects. Most of these will probably be for use in a Unity context, though I may expand it to include tools for Godot and Unreal as well. Some of these will be agnostic of game engines, such as renaming asset files.

I'll try to organize things better as I add more to it.

## Python? In a Visual Studio Project?

I'm lazy, sorry D:

In high school and college I got in the habit of making quick scripts in Python for doing tedious things and the habit has stayed with me. Also the Visual Studio tools for Python are pretty nice and it keeps me from switching contexts throughout the day since I'm mostly in Visual Studio already anyway (:heart: Xamarin, Unity, and .NET Standard/Core).

## Contributing

Probably won't take pull requests or anything just yet since I'm still not sure how this will look once I add more to it. Feel free to use my code as a reference or whatever for your own work. Once there is enough momentum on this I will add a proper contribution guide.
